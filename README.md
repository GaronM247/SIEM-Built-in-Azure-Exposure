<h2>Description</h2>
  In this lab session, I will lead you through the intricacies of configuring Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and establishing a connection with a dynamic virtual machine, simulating a honey pot. Collaboratively, we will witness real-time instances of RDP Brute Force attacks originating from diverse global locations. Our analytical approach will be elevated through the utilization of a meticulously crafted PowerShell script, enabling the extraction of geolocation data pertaining to the attacker's. This data will be adeptly visualized on the Azure Sentinel Map, culminating in a dynamic and informative experience. Join me on this captivating expedition of knowledge and exploration.
